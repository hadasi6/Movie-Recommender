# Ex5-Movie Recommender

This project is the 5th exercise from the Programming Workshop in C & C++ at HUJI.

The goal is to implement a movie recommendation system using STL data structures and smart pointers.                                                           
The system supports content-based and collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms.

Key Features:
- Content-based and collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms.
- Utilizes STL data structures and smart pointers for efficient memory management.
